This package was build on an Ubuntu machine, using the script provided in

  gnuarmeclipse/scripts/build-qemu.sh

To run it, first be sure the the packages required in the Prerequisites 
section are installed, then copy the script and execute it with bash:

  bash build-qemu.sh

The output of the build script is a setup in the ${QEMU_WORK}/output 
folder.

To build the latest version of the package please use the script from:

  wget https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/qemu/ci/gnuarmeclipse/tree/gnuarmeclipse/scripts/build-qemu.sh?format=raw \
  -O ~/Downloads/build-qemu.sh

  bash ~/Downloads/build-qemu.sh

The script was developed on Ubuntu 14 LTS x64 with MinGW-w64. Running it on other 
versions is possible, but might require some adjustments.

Up-to-date build informations are available in the GNU ARM Eclipse project wiki:

Many thanks to my friend Dan Maiorescu for his major contributions 
to this project.
